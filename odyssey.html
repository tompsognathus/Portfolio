    <h1>Odyssey</h1>
    <h3>A Visual Novel RPG</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="odyssey-intro text-muted">
        Many years ago, the Goblins of the Turtle Cove led simple lives. They were farmers, shepherds, fishermen...
        Every morning, as the sun came up over the Westward hills, music would fill the air
        as the Goblins emerged from their huts, ready for another ordinary, but busy day. More than anything,
        the goblins loved to dream of great adventures and to sing tales of noble deeds, but the last thing
        a goblin would ever want is to actually put on a pair of sturdy boots, pick up a walking stick, and leave 
        their beloved shores.

        The Goblins never showed much interest in interfering with the workings of the wider world, and, for the most part, 
        the world left them alone. Life was good.
        <br><br>
        Until, one day, a weary stranger washed up on shore, right in the centre of Goblintown. Without a moment's 
        hesitation, the goblins rushed to aid the traveler, and slowly nursed him back to consciousness. 
        Desperate, the stranger presented his plea. He was a sailor, he said, and his ship had been wrecked in a storm.
        He had been the only survivor, and he had been drifting at sea for days, until he had finally washed up on the
        shores of the Turtle Shores. He had been on a mission, he said, to find a mysterious island, far to the East.
        According to legend, the island was home to a magical plant that could cure the worst of diseases. 

        The goblins agreed to help the stranger and got to work. They built a ship, and, less than a month
        later, with heavy hearts, a group of the strongest and fittest among them set sail to the East, in search of 
        the mysterious island.
